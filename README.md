# veinitiuno (21) - game

## Instructions


Welcome to one the funniest and most entertaining game of all times. 
In order to start having fun, there are just a few simple rules that you have to follow:


### Constraints
1. As current player you will need to get a combination of dices by shuffling the dices.
2. The resulting combination, is going to be always read starting with the highest number (for example a combination (3,6) will be read sixty-three as six is the highest number).
3. As you might be thinking the highest combination a player can get is (6,6) sixty-six. But the truth is that there is another combination that can beat (6,6), and it is (2,1) Twenty-one, aka Veintiuno.
4. The fun of the game consists in whether you believe what the previous player is telling you about his/her combination.
5. If you believe it, simply shuffle the dice again and tell your combination to the next player. Else, reveal the current combination to see if the previous player was lying.
    - If you catch him/her lying. He/she looses and you will need to set "punishment" for him. Example: Drink one liter of water ;)
    - Otherwise, you sets the "punishment"

### Consideration 
1. A player has to shake the mobile phone in order to shuffle the dice.
2. To reveal the resulting dice's combination you have to swipe up to show it and swipe down to hide it. But nobody can see the combination but you.
3. The goal of this game is to trick your adversaries to make them believe in you.
4. You always need to get a higher combination than the previous player, if you fail and you can't lie properly, there is still a chance to save your turn. You will need to make the previous player repeat his/her combination, asking questions such as: “how much did you get?”,  "How much did you say that you rolled” or in general the response to “how much” questions. If you manage to get the answer you get the "punishment", otherwise there is no way to save you, you will be "punished".


Have fun!!
